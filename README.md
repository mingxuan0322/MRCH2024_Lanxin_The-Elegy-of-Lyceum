## Abstract
"The Elegy of Lyceum" is an interactive mixed-reality project that utilizes Unity3D,
augmented reality (AR), and real-world street design to digitally preserve and
reimagine the cultural heritage of Shanghai's Lyceum Theater and the adjacent Lyceum
Building. By combining historical narratives with advanced digital tools, this project
showcases the potential of AR and interactive media as platforms for cultural heritage
conservation and storytelling.

The project explores the role of digital technologies in documenting and reconstructing
cultural heritage. Players embark on a reverse chronological journey through significant
historical periods (2024, 1955, 1929, and 1871), engaging with key events that shaped
the identity of these iconic locations. Interactive storytelling, enhanced by Unity3D’s
game mechanics, blends seamlessly with AR-based exploration of the theater's
architecture and surrounding streets, offering an immersive experience rooted in both
physical and virtual spaces.

Key features include AR scenes designed for real-world testing, digital reconstructions
modeled in Blender, and AI-generated content for interactive objects. The integration
of spatial design with storytelling elements encourages players to interact with artifacts
such as a ledger, umbrella, and manuscript, each pivotal to unveiling the theater’s

layered history. Themes of memory, legacy, and the evolving relationship between
authenticity and modernization are central to the narrative, sparking reflection on the
preservation of cultural spaces amidst rapid urbanization.

By bridging fiction and reality, "The Elegy of Lyceum" demonstrates how VR, AR, and
interactive media can serve as innovative tools for cultural heritage preservation. This
project underscores the importance of memory and storytelling in maintaining cultural
identity, while presenting an engaging model for integrating digital design with heritage
conservation efforts.
